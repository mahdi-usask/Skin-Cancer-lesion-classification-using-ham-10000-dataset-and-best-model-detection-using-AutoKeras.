# Skin-Cancer-lesion-classification-using-ham-10000-dataset-and-best-model-detection-using-AutoKeras.
The dataset used here is ham 10000 having 7 classes. I have done a good preprocessing of data here. I have used the metadata file details to match images and it's classification then labeled those images as per their class. The dataset is heavily imbalanced so i have done a data balancing for better accuracy. I have separated the classes first and then I have resampled the dataset to 500 samples for each class to balance it. Then made a different dataframe by concatenating the balanced data. Then i added a new column containing the resized (32*32) image of that specific classes as numpy array using lamda function. Then i scaled it and did the data processing for test and train dataset. Then i have used AutoKeras to get the best model for it and then i have used that model to train and predict. The using Argmax, i got the classification.
